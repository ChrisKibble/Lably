# Credits!

No one does a project like this completely alone, here is where I'll thank some folks that have helped me along the way :)

## Friends!

Adam Cook [[Web](https://adamcook.io/)] [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/codaamok)] from the [WinAdmins](https://winadmins.io) community. It was with Adam that I realized I wanted to start this project and he inspired me a dozen times at least along the way. Adam is also an amazing sounding board for this and all of my other projects.

Anthony Fontanez [[Web](https://anthonyfontanez.com/)] [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajf8729)] and HeyZeus [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jahnke_3E9)] also from the [WinAdmins](https://winadmins.io) community who all told me I was going in the right direction and that this would be useful, I hope they're right. 

Chris (ccatlett1984#4498) and Kieteldood#2051 from the [WinAdmins](https://winadmins.io) #PowerShell channel, who were there to help me when I hit road bumps.
