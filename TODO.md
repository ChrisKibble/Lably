# TODO List

- In `Get-AnswersToInputQuestions` we use the OS langauge and then fall back to the first entry. Allow user to define language to be asked questions in.
- We need an escape character for `[[VARIABLES]]`.
- When creating a new NAT rule in `New-Lably`, we need to add the `$NATIP` to the Scaffold.
- When creating a new VM, if there is as NAT IP in use, remind the user what that IP is for use in their VM.
- Validate the Incoming Index number in `New-LablyBaseVHD`.
- All user to set VHDx Size in `New-LablyBaseVHD`.
- Support for non-Windows OS.
- When using a non English OS, the `Administrator` account might be spelled some other way, account for this in `New-LablyVM`.
- Test for Hyper-V support and installation before any lab creation.
- Setup inline help for all public modules.
- Accept answers to template questions as hash table.
- Accept answers to template questions as answer file (json?).
- Save answers to questions in scaffold.
- Cache templates in Lably scaffold path.
- Rebuild labs based on answers defined and cached template(s).
- Servicing of BaseVHDs (when not being used by VMs).
- Ability to provide ISOs or Binaries to templates for post-build installs (SQL, SCCM, etc.)
- Create Credits markdown file.
- Lably friendly output with Get-LablyISODetails, New-LablyBaseVHD, Register-LablyBaseVHD, Remove-Lably, Remove-LablyVM, Start-Lably, and Stop-Lably.
